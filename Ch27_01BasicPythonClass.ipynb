    "# Python Class:\n",
    "Python class- a coding structure and device to implement new kind of objects n python that support inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Ojects defined with classes look likebuilt-in type. Classes are designed\n",
    "to create and manage new objects and support inheritnace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance: \n",
    "Common properties are inherted, new properties can be defined\n",
    "\n",
    "### Composition: \n",
    "Many things work together to follow succesful implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes are factories for generating one or more objects. Each call to class creates a new object with distinct namespace. Each object generated from a class has access to class's attributes and gets a namespace of its own for data that varies per object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Customization via inheritance:\n",
    "classes also support the OOP notion of inheritance; extend a class by \n",
    "redifining its attributes outside the class in a subclass. \n",
    "\n",
    "More generally classes can build namespace hierarchies, which define names to be used by by objects created from classes in hierarchy. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Operator overloading:\n",
    "Classes can define objects that respond to operation  e.g slicing, concat\n",
    "etc\n",
    "\n",
    "### OOP Story for python==> object.attribute\n",
    "When we say this is an object that is derived from a class statement, the\n",
    "expression kicks off a search in Python. It searches a tree of linked\n",
    "objects, looking for the first appearance of attribute that it can find.\n",
    "\n",
    "When classes are involved, the preceding Python expression effectively \n",
    "translates to : Find the first occurence of attribute by looking in object\n",
    "then in all classes above it, from bottom to top and left to right\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, attribute fetches are simply tree searches. The term\n",
    "inheritance is applied because objects lower in a tree inherit attributes\n",
    "attached to objects higher in that tree. As the search proceeds from \n",
    "bottom up, in a sense, the objects linked into a tree are union of all \n",
    "all the attributes defined in all their tree parents, all the way  up \n",
    "the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes serve as instance factories. Their attributes provide behavior\n",
    "data and fucntions, that is inherited by all instances generated from them\n",
    "\n",
    "Instance: Represent the concrete items in program's domain. Their attributes record data that varies per specific object data e.g SSN\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of search trees, an instance inherits attributes from its class\n",
    "and class inherits attributes from all classes above it in the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes and Instances:\n",
    "Although they are two seprate object types in python model, the classes\n",
    "and instance in trees are almost identifical. Each type's main purpose\n",
    "is to serve as another kind of namespace - a package for variables and place where we can attach attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this respect they are like modules, but objects in class trees also have\n",
    "automatically searched links to other namespace objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary difference between classes and instance is that classes are a\n",
    "a kind of factory for generating instances. E.g Employeee class that \n",
    "defines what it means to be a good employee, from that class we generate\n",
    "actual Employee instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Method calls:\n",
    "When we call object.method, this call is translated to \n",
    "class.method to process object. That is python automatically maps \n",
    "the call object.method() into class.method(object), passing in the instance\n",
    "as the first argument in the inherited function. Infact, whenever we call\n",
    "a function attached to a class in this fashion, an instance of the class\n",
    "is always implied. This implied subject or context is part of the reason\n",
    "we refer to this as an object oriented model- there is always a subject\n",
    "object when an operation is run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Realistic example: we might invoke a method called give Raise attached\n",
    "as an attribute to Employee class, such a call has no meaning unless\n",
    "qualified with the employee to whom the raise is given.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see later that, Python passes in the implied instance to a special\n",
    "argument in the method called self by convertion. Methods go through this\n",
    "argument to process the subject of the call. Methods can also be called\n",
    "through either an instance -bob.giveRaise() or as a class \n",
    "Employee.giveRaise(bob) and both forms serve purpose in the scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "bob.giveRaise() method: looks up giveRaise from bob by inheritance search\n",
    "and passes bob to the located giveRaise function, in the special self \n",
    "argument\n",
    "\n",
    "when calling Employee.giveRaise(bob), the same steps are performed, but here we specify the argument = instance bob to the class method giveRaise()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Class Trees:\n",
    "Each class statement generates a new class objects. Each time a class is called, it generates a new instance object. Instances are automatically linked to the classes from which they are created. Classes are automatically linked to the superclasses according to the way\n",
    "we list them in parentheses in a class header line; left to righ order\n",
    "gives the order of tree\n"
